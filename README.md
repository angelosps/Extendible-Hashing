# üóÉÔ∏è Extendible Hashing 

A block level implementation of [Extendible Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing) for both _primary_ and _secondary_ indexing in database systems.

## Usage
A block level library named `BlockFile` is given for managing the memory.  
**Warning!** The library is only compatible with linux machines, so you must be connected to a linux machine to run this repository.
In order to run primary and/or secondary extendible hashing indexing just type on a terminal the following:

``` 
$ make primary    # Compiles primary indexing
$ make secondary  # Compiles secondary indexing
$ make runp       # Runs primary
$ make runs       # Runs secondary

$ make clean 
```
